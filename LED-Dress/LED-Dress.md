# LED-dress

### Brief

I'm always crazy about beautiful dresses and glittering things. Thus I want to combine them together.
This is a dress on which the LEDs blink in different colors or patterns according to the wearer's movement.
I look forward to see someone dancing in it.

### Technology

- A gyroscope sensor or an acceleration sensor (or any other sensors?) will be used to detect the movement of the wearer.
- LEDs, or LED strips, or LED fibers will be fixed onto a dress or a skirt. 
- Multiplexers might be used to connect a large amount of LEDs.
- Programming in Arduino and Processing to define colors and glittering pattern of LEDs according to signals of movement.
- Time-lapse photography
- Additionally, sounds might also be made according to movement. (Undecided. Silence is great. Too much sounds might be annoying sometimes.)

Just Start.
