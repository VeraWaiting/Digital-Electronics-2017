# Arduino Piano

### Brief 

As a person who have played the piano for more than ten years, I want to create a musical instrument that can show the beauty of piano and is easily controlled by those who have never leaned to play the piano.

It's not something just for fun. It can be really functional and be used by professionals or non-professional to create stream-like melodies or provide a accompany for people singing.

### Technology 

Six light sensors are used to control six most frequently used chords, i.e., C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am.
Six LEDs are used to show which chord is being played.
Sounds are produced by computer, using Minim library of Processing.

### Continuing 

I'm still working on it. I'll solder a circuit board for it to replace the breadboard. And I'll create a beautiful appearence for it.
