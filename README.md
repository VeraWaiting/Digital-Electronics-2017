Digital Electronics - Homework 1



I. Singing Plant:

http://www.instructables.com/id/Singing-plant-Make-your-plant-sing-with-Arduino-/

The plant will make sounds when someone touches it.
"By connecting a capacitance sensor to a plant we can detect if people are touching it and convert the touch into sound."



II. Sensors:

Force sensitive resistor (FSR) - detects physical pressure, squeezing and weight.

Photocells - detect light/dark, breakbeams, simple object detection

Temperature - determine environmental temperature

Tilt sensors - detect motion/vibration and orientation or inclination

PIR sensors - detect motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range

Thermocouple - temperature measurements, usually those above 150Â°C

IR receivers - detect IR signals from remote controls
