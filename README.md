I.

The plant will make sounds when someone touches it.
"By connecting a capacitance sensor to a plant we can detect if people are touching it and convert the touch into sound."

Mesa Musical Shadows is a public installation that turns the sidewalk of Arizona’s Mesa Arts Center into a super-sized dance pad which reacts to the shadows of passersby with the sounds of singing.



II. Sensors:

Force sensitive resistor (FSR) - detects physical pressure, squeezing and weight.

Photocells - detect light/dark, breakbeams, simple object detection

Temperature - determine environmental temperature

Tilt sensors - detect motion/vibration and orientation or inclination

PIR sensors - detect motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range

Thermocouple - temperature measurements, usually those above 150°C

IR receivers - detect IR signals from remote controls
