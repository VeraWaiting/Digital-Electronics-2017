Digital Electronics - Homework 1



1. Singing Plant:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Singing-plant-Make-your-plant-sing-with-Arduino-/

The plant will make sounds when someone touches it.
"By connecting a capacitance sensor to a plant we can detect if people are touching it and convert the touch into sound."



2. Sensors:

Force sensitive resistor (FSR) - Thin sensor that detects physical pressure, squeezing and weight.

Photocells - Used to detect light/dark, breakbeams, simple object detection
Temperature - Used to determine environmental temperature
Tilt sensors - Used to detect motion/vibration and orientation.
PIR sensors - Used to detect motion activity such as animals or people
Thermocouple - Used for temperature measurements, usually those above 150Â°C
IR receivers - Used to detect IR signals from remote controls
